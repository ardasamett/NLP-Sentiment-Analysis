## NLP Sentiment Analysis | Restaurant Reviews Classification

This notebook is a simple sentiment analysis exercise. The aim is to have an introductory knowledge of NLP's "Data Preprocessing", "Bag Of Words" and "Machine Learning" steps.

## Why did I choose this dataset?

I had just finished an Introductory NLP Course. And I needed a simple dataset where I could practice what I learned. It is also a very suitable data set to quickly develop NLP Classification Machine Learning Algorithm.

## What was my aim and did I succeed?

I wanted to practice NLP, which I had just learned, and to learn how NLP-Machine Learning disciplines combine.

I achieved everything I wanted. I learned "Data Preprocessing","Bag Of Words" and "Machine Learning" steps for NLP.


## What could I have done better ? (TO-DO)

If I had covered "Data Preprocessing", "Bag Of Words" more deeply, I could have built more successful machine learning models.

## What did I learn from this analysis?

* I learned "Data Preprocessing", "Bag Of Words" and "Machine Learning" steps for NLP
* I learned that "Data Preprocessing", "Bag Of Words" are more important than "Machine Learning" for NLP
